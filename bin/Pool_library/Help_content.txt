Please read the following instructions before creating a new pool for simulation:
You shall follow the following format for crating a pool file if u wish a manual entry:
Part 1: [Pool_name]##[number of type of rarity]##
Part 2: ####[Rarity number]#[Probability]#([GuaranteePull Ceiling]#[the number of pull where probability starts climbing])#[Name of rarity]
List of item(one for each line)
###[Rarity number]#[Probability]#([GuaranteePull Ceiling]#[the number of pull where probability starts climbing])#[Name of rarity]
List of item(one for each line)
###... until all rarity info is entered



For example:
--------------------
Star of wishes##3##
####3 0.05 90 72   -- start climbing prob from 72 draws up until 100% in the 90th draw
Helia#event  --There should be only one character with maximum rareness and event followed
Tricia
Selena
###2 10.00 10 9       
Lucy
Allemond
Very long sword
###1 89.95
long sword
----------------------
This is a valid pool info input

1.The probability of each item in each pool is evenly spread out for the same rarity except for the highest where there is any #event item
2. Guarantee pulls prioritise items with lower rarity levels
3.#event mark suggests that this item will be selected by a 50% chance for every pull selecting items from this rarity level. If this item is not selected once it will definitely be selected the next time
#event mark could only appear in the maximum rarity level
