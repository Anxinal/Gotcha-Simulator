Please read the following instructions before creating a new pool for simulation:
You shall follow the following format for crating a pool file if u wish a manual entry:
line 1: [Pool_name]##[number of type of rareness in decimals] (if 90% then input 90, if it is decimal then up to 2.d.p.)
line 2: [Name of item type 1] [Name of item type 2] ...(There should not be any spacing in each name)
line 3 : [Rareness 1 probability] [Rareness 2 probability] [Rareness 3 probability]

line 4 onwards: ###[rarity_level]
[Item name](#event)
"#event" suggests that this is an event character. If not, omit this part.

For example:
--------------------
Star of wishes##3##
####3 0.05 90 72   -- start climbing prob from 72 draws up until 100% in the 90th draw
Helia#event  --There should be only one character with maximum rareness and event followed
Tricia
Urga
###2 10.00 10 9       
Lucy
Allemond
Very long sword
###1 89.95
long sword
----------------------
This is a valid pool info input

1.The probability of each item in each pool is evenly spread out for the same rarity
2. There could only be one type of guarantee item and the probability of drawing the guarantee item climbs 
by 5% by default from 20 pools before guarantee
3.
